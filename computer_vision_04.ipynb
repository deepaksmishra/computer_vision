        "1. What is the concept of cyclical momentum?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Learning rate might be the most important hyper parameter in deep learning, as learning rate decides how much gradient to be back propagated. This in turn decides by how much we move towards minima. The small learning rate makes model converge slowly, while the large learning rate makes model diverge. So, the learning rate needs to be just correct\n",

        "2. What callback keeps track of hyperparameter values (along with other data) during training?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Early stopping requires that a validation dataset is evaluated during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be achieved by specifying the validation dataset to the fit() function when training your model.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways of doing this.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first involves you manually splitting your training data into a train and validation dataset and specifying the validation dataset to the fit() function via the validation_data argument. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the color dim plot, what does one column of pixels represent?\n",
        "Ans: wo dimensional tables have both rows and columns. You have probably seen many tables like this if you have used a spreadsheet program. Another object that is organized in rows and columns is a digital image. In this section we will explore how iteration allows us to manipulate these images.\n",
        "\n",
        "A digital image is a finite collection of small, discrete picture elements called pixels. These pixels are organized in a two-dimensional grid. Each pixel represents the smallest amount of picture information that is available. Sometimes these pixels appear as small “dots”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each image (grid of pixels) has its own width and its own height. The width is the number of columns and the height is the number of rows. We can name the pixels in the grid by using the column number and row number. However, it is very important to remember that computer scientists like to start counting with 0! This means that if there are 20 rows, they will be named 0,1,2, and so on through 19. This will be very useful later when we iterate using range.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the figure below, the pixel of interest is found at column c and row r.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Does a batch normalization layer have any trainable parameters?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Consequently, batch normalization adds two trainable parameters to each layer, so the normalized output is multiplied by a “standard deviation” parameter (gamma) and add a “mean” parameter (beta).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. In batch normalization during preparation, what statistics are used to normalize? What about during the validation process?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "I’ve reimplemented the Batch Normalization layer with Pytorch to reproduce the original paper results. The code is available on this github repository.\n",
        "I recommend that you take a look at some of the implementations of BN layer available online. It is very instructive to see how it is coded in your favorite framework !\n",
        "C.2) BN layer in practice\n",
        "Before diving into the theory, let’s start with what’s certain about Batch Normalization.\n",
        "In this section, we’ll see:\n",
        "How does BN impact training performances ? Why is this method so important in Deep Learning nowadays ?\n",
        "What are the BN side-effects we must be aware of ?\n",
        "When and how should we use BN ?\n",
        "C.2.1) Results from the original article\n",
        "As previously stated, BN is widely used because it almost always makes deep learning models perform much better.\n",
        "The official article [1] carried out 3 experiments to show their method effectiveness.\n",
        "At first, they have trained a classifier on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits). The model consists of 3 fully connected layers of 100 neurons each, all activated by sigmoid function. They have trained this model twice (with and without BN layers) for 50 000 iterations, using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and the same learning rate (0.01). Notice that BN layers were put right before the activation function.\n",
        "You can easily reproduce those results without GPU, it’s a great way to get more familiar with this concept !\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 2 : How does BN affects the training of a simple Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) | Left : Training accuracy w.r.t. iterations | Right : Training loss w.r.t iterations | Credit : author\n",
        "Looks good ! Batch Normalization increases our network performances, regarding both the loss and the accuracy.\n",
        "The 2nd experiment consists of taking a look at the activation values in the hidden layers. Here are the plots corresponding to the last hidden layer (right before the nonlinearity) :\n",

        "\n",
        "7. Why do batch normalization layers help models generalize better?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Batch normalization is a technique to standardize the inputs to a network, applied to ether the activations of a prior layer or inputs directly. Batch normalization accelerates training, in some cases by halving the epochs or better, and provides some regularization, reducing generalization error.\n",

        "8.Explain between MAX POOLING and AVERAGE POOLING is number eight.\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "\n",
        "A problem with the output feature maps is that they are sensitive to the location of the features in the input. One approach to address this sensitivity is to down sample the feature maps. This has the effect of making the resulting down sampled feature maps more robust to changes in the position of the feature in the image, referred to by the technical phrase “local translation invariance.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Pooling layers provide an approach to down sampling feature maps by summarizing the presence of features in patches of the feature map. Two common pooling methods are average pooling and max pooling that summarize the average presence of a feature and the most activated presence of a feature respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you will discover how the pooling operation works and how to implement it in convolutional neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the purpose of the POOLING LAYER?\n",
        "Ans: Pooling layer is the building block of CNN. The main purpose of a pooling layer is to reduce the spatial size of your image so that we need less number of pixels and hence less number of features or parameters for further computations.\n",

        "10. Why do we end up with Completely CONNECTED LAYERS?\n",
        "Ans: Fully connected layers are convolutions. We think of them as different and we calculate them differently for efficiency, but they are really the same thing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why fully connected layers are convolution layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "A convolution layer takes a weighted sum of pixels in a certain region.\n",
        "\n",
        "A fully connected layer takes a weighted sum of pixels in the entire input to that layer. In this case, the “region” happens to be the entire thing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Edit: Oops, I forgot to answer why we use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why we use fully connected layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, it's because we want our output to be a scalar and we already know the size of the input. That means we know exactly what size convolution (the region I was talking about earlier) will get us a scalar: the whole input size.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's common to use things like global pooling layers instead because they shrink the parameter count and work regardless of input size.\n",

        "11. What do you mean by PARAMETERS?\n",
        "Ans: : a rule or limit that controls what something is or how something should be done.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Why do we end up with Completely CONNECTED LAYERS?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "The output from the convolutional layers represents high-level features in the data. While that output could be flattened and connected to the output layer, adding a fully-connected layer is a (usually) cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of these features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially the convolutional layers are providing a meaningful, low-dimensional, and somewhat invariant feature space, and the fully-connected layer is learning a (possibly non-linear) function in that space.\n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE: It is trivial to convert from FC layers to Conv layers. Converting these top FC layers to Conv layers can be helpful as this page describes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What formulas are used to measure these PARAMETERS?\n",
        "Ans: Measurement activities are used to measure something. It is the estimation of ratios of a certain quantity. It is made by comparing some quantity with the standard unit. These are used to find the size, length, area, perimeter, volume or amount of something. Measurement Formulas are used to find the distance, area, surface area, volume, circumference, density, mass, etc. Sometimes we are doing the conversions like conversion of an inch to feet, kilometer to miles, etc.\n",
