        "Ans: In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon. \n",
        "The concept of \"feature\" is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. For a top edge detector, write out the convolutional kernel matrix.\n",
        "Ans: An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, such as blurring, sharpening, outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', a technique for determining the most important portions of an image. In this context the process is referred to more generally as \"convolution\" (see: convolutional neural networks.)\n",
        "\n",
        "To see how they work, let's start by inspecting a black and white image. The matrix on the left contains numbers, between 0 and 255, which each correspond to the brightness of one pixel in a picture of a face. The large, granulated picture has been blown up to make it easier to see; the last image is the \"real\" size.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Describe the mathematical operation that a 3x3 kernel performs on a single pixel in an image.\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "We use imread() object to read the image. By default cv2.imread() reads the image in the format of Blue, Green, and Red. We need to convert it into Red, Blue, and Green format, that makes sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the significance of a convolutional kernel added to a 3x3 matrix of zeroes?\n",
        "Ans: A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network that has one or more convolutional layers and are used mainly for image processing, classification, segmentation and also for other auto correlated data.\n",
        "A convolution is essentially sliding a filter over the input. One helpful way to think about convolutions is this quote from Dr Prasad Samarakoon: “A convolution can be thought as “looking at a function’s surroundings to make better/accurate predictions of its outcome.”\n",
        "Rather than looking at an entire image at once to find certain features it can be more effective to look at smaller portions of the image.\n",
        "Common uses for CNNs\n",
        "The most common use for CNNs is image classification, for example identifying satellite images that contain roads or classifying hand written letters and digits. There are other quite mainstream tasks such as image segmentation and signal processing, for which CNNs perform well at.\n",
        "CNNs have been used for understanding in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition, although often for NLP Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) are used.\n",
        "A CNN can also be implemented as a U-Net architecture, which are essentially two almost mirrored CNNs resulting in a CNN whose architecture can be presented in a U shape. U-nets are used where the output needs to be of similar size to the input such as segmentation and image improvement.\n",
        "Interesting uses for CNNs other than image processing\n",
        "More and more diverse and interesting uses are being found for CNN architectures. An example of a non-image based application is “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Population Genetic Inference” by Lex Flagel et al. This is used to perform selective sweeps, finding gene flow, inferring population size changes, inferring rate of recombination.\n",
        "There are researchers such as Professor Gerald Quon at the Quon-titative biology lab, using CNNs for generative models in single cell genomics for disease identification.\n",
        "CNNs are also being used in astrophysics to interpret radio telescope data to predict the likely visual image to represent the data.\n",
        "Deepmind’s WaveNet is a CNN model for generating synthesized voice, used as the basis for Google’s Assistant’s voice synthesizer.\n",
        "Convolutional kernels\n",
        "Each convolutional layer contains a series of filters known as convolutional kernels. The filter is a matrix of integers that are used on a subset of the input pixel values, the same size as the kernel. Each pixel is multiplied by the corresponding value in the kernel, then the result is summed up for a single value for simplicity representing a grid cell, like a pixel, in the output channel/feature map.\n",
        "These are linear transformations, each convolution is a type of affine function.\n",
        "In computer vision the input is often a 3 channel RGB image. For simplicity, if we take a greyscale image that has one channel (a two dimensional matrix) and a 3x3 convolutional kernel (a two dimensional matrix). The kernel strides over the input matrix of numbers moving horizontally column by column, sliding/scanning over the first rows in the matrix containing the images pixel values. Then the kernel strides down vertically to subsequent rows. Note, the filter may stride over one or several pixels at a time, this is detailed further below.\n",
        "In other non-vision applications, a one dimensional convolution may slide vertically over an input matrix.\n",

        "5. What exactly is padding?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Padding is the space that’s inside the element between the element and the border. Padding goes around all four sides of the content and you can target and change the padding for each side (just like a margin).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the concept of stride?\n",
        "Ans: \n",
        "Strides are also known as striders, stride-outs, or accelerations. They're about 100m accelerations where you start at a jog, build to about 95% of your max speed, and then gradually slow to a stop. One stride should take you about 20-30 seconds depending on your ability.\n",

        "In the public switched telephone network (PSTN), a channel is one of multiple transmission paths within a single link between network points. For example, the commonly used (in North America) T-carrier system line service provides 24 64 Kbps channels for digital data transmission.\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "it is possible and you should also use a doubly block circulant matrix (which is a special case of Toeplitz matrix). I will give you an example with a small size of kernel and the input, but it is possible to construct Toeplitz matrix for any kernel. So you have a 2d input x and 2d kernel k and you want to calculate the convolution x * k. Also let's assume that k is already flipped. Let's also assume that x is of size n×n and k is m×m.\n",
        "\n",
        "So you unroll k into a sparse matrix of size (n-m+1)^2 × n^2, and unroll x into a long vector n^2 × 1. You compute a multiplication of this sparse matrix with a vector and convert the resulting vector (which will have a size (n-m+1)^2 × 1) into a n-m+1 square matrix.\n",
